## Why a battery?

A battery is something everyone already understands. Full means you're good. Half means pace yourself. No documentation required.

Tokens just don't *feel* like anything to me. However once Opus 4.6 landed, I was quickly aware I needed to keep an eye on usage.

I have watched (probably) millions of them tick over in Claude Cowork or Claude Code, but unless you've memorized your plan's limits, the numbers are noise (and then change your plan and the goalposts move again). More and more of my colleagues who are marketers, designers, writers or creatives use Claude daily. They just don't think in tokens or try to optimize for chasing the bleeding edge of token min/maxing, but they did find themselves constantly having to go into Claude > Settings > Usage and double check they weren't setting their quota on fire -- that's why I built this. That said, if you're an engineer who wants usage monitoring that stays out of the way... you're exactly who this is for too.

There are other good usage widgets out there... great ones in fact. Claude Battery takes a different approach: **what can we remove** instead of what can we add - or ["Simplify, and add lightness"](https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/genius-colin-chapman-simplify-then-add-lightness%E2%80%9D) in the words of Chapman. The result is something lightweight enough to forget it's running, and clear enough to understand at a glance. 

And lastly, ["Invert, always invert".](https://www.stripe.press/poor-charlies-almanack/talk-four?progress=14.36%#:~:text=The%20third%20helpful,an%20irrational%20number.)

After deciding on the approach and general design direction, as I was searching for UI inspiration I came across this MacBook app that inspired aspects of the popover visualisations: [Watts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/watts/id422559334?mt=12) on the Mac App Store.
